# Merging UKB and LB data
To do the power analysis, it was decided to merge the UKB and LB data. 

In the merging, we need to decide on a common education parameter. For UKB we have decided on university education and non-university education. For most LB data we have years of education as a parameter. We have decided to use the threshold of 15 years of education as university education, and 15 years and less as non-university education.
